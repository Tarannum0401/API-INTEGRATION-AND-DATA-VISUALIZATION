### FIRST OF ALL I DOWNLOADED VISUL STDIO CODE AND THEN CREATED A NEW FOLDER AND THEN CREATED A NEW FILE,THROUGH WHICH I PERFORMED MY TASK. BASICALLY MY TASK WAS OF API INTEGRATION AND DATA VISUALIZATION , THROUGH WHICH I HAD TO FIND OUT WEATHER USING API IN DIFFERENT CITY.DURING THIS TASK,I LEARNED TO USE WEATHER MAP AND GENERATE API ID AND THEN CRATE TASKS USING THEM.I READ ABOUT MANY NEW MODULES DURING THIS TASK AND LEARNED HOW TO GENERATE API. I LEARNED A LOT OF NEW THINGS FROM THIS TASK. THANK YOU GIVING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY.###
